# pll

A simple NodeJS script to help run commands in parallel ("pll" === "parallel").

**WARNING**: Do not pass unsanitized user input to `pll`!

`pll` is just a basic wrapper for Node's `exec` function. It doesn't do anything with the output other than provide a way to read it.

## Usage

See `example.js`.
